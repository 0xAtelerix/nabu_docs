# Ecosystem and economics

## Partners

Nabu is designed as an open, execution-grade system that benefits from deep partnerships across venues, solvers, wallets, custodians, and infrastructure providers. Each partner category integrates at a well-defined interface and participates in a shared execution and verification layer, enabling scale without bespoke integrations.

### Venues and solvers

Value proposition: integrate once, receive distributed orderflow from strategies. Nabu provides:

- Standardized intents and solver interface.  
- Measurable execution objectives (price, latency, success rate).  
- Reputation and quality ranking for solvers.

This model allows venues and solvers to compete on execution quality rather than proprietary integrations.

### Wallets and custodians

Value proposition: offer users safe automation without taking custody.

- Policy-bound execution and explicit permissions.  
- Selective disclosure and receipts for auditability.  
- Configuration profiles for retail, power users, and institutions.

Wallets and custodians can support automation while preserving user control and compliance boundaries.

### Data and infrastructure partners

- Publish attested feeds into Pelagos as canonical inputs for strategies.  
- Provide venue connectivity, liquidity, and execution services to solvers.

This creates a common data and execution substrate that reduces fragmentation across venues and infrastructure providers.

Together, these partnerships extend Nabu’s execution surface while preserving a single, verifiable strategy and execution model. By standardizing interfaces and incentives across participants, Nabu enables an ecosystem where execution quality, safety, and scale improve through collaboration rather than custom integration.
